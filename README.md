# Titanic Survival Analysis Dashboard
## 📌 Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing passenger survival patterns from the Titanic disaster using data analysis and visualization techniques. The objective is to identify how factors such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and family size influenced survival outcomes.

The analysis includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Feature engineering

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation analysis

- Interactive dashboard visualization

- Interpretation of survival patterns

This project demonstrates practical implementation of data analysis using Python and helps build strong foundational skills in real-world dataset exploration.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains passenger information from the Titanic, including:

- Passenger ID

- Gender

- Age

- Passenger Class (Pclass)

- Fare

- Number of Siblings/Spouses (SibSp)

- Number of Parents/Children (Parch)

- Embarkation Port

- Survival Status

The dataset is used strictly for educational and analytical purposes.
